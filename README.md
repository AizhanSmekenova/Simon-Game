Get ready to watch, remember, repeat! The Simon game is the exciting electronic game of lights and sounds in which players must repeat random sequences of lights by pressing the colored pads in the correct order. It's fast-paced play, with lights and sounds that can challenge you. Experience the fun as you repeat the patterns and advance to higher levels.

In this game I mastered some basics of DOM manipulations, arrays in JS, sounds in JS and JQuery.
